Once you [acquire](/docs/overview/getting-started) your `project_id` token, let's give the API a try! You need to pass this it as an HTTP header with the name `project_id`. Don't forget that you can call just the network you created the token for.

:::info
Each network has separate `project_id` tokens, distinguishable by the prefix.
:::

In this example, we set `project_id` as an environment variable and then use it to call the API. Don't forget to replace the `PROJECT_ID` in the example with your newly generated one!
